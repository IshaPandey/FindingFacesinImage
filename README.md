# FindingFacesinImage
Face detection : It is an ability to detect and locate human faces in photographs.
Face detection Algorithms:
1) Viola-Jones
2) Histogram of oriented Gradients (HOG)
3) Convolutional Neural Networks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following project is created using Histogram of oriented Gradients (HOG).
Finding Faces in image with Histogram of oriented Gradients (HOG) features"
1) Collecting Training Data:
     Collecting images with different faces and converting them to HOG representations.These converted image will be our training data.
2) Train face classifier on HOG faces
   We will use HOG representations for training the Machine Learning Model.
3)Sliding window classifier on HOG
